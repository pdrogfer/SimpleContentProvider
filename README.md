# Simple Content Provider

### Description
This code is a sample Android Studio project, just another chapter in my **Simple** series, this time to demonstrate the basic implementation of a Content Provider in Android.

### Usage
As usual, navigate the code to study how it works, or even better clone it:
```
git clone https://github.com/pdrogfer/simple-content-provider.git simple-content-provider
```
Feel free to send me pull requests to improve the example code. Give me a **star** if this
was useful to you. Use and have fun!
